## Key Learnings
From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: Gained experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, and subsequently converting those insights into strategic recommendations.

Storytelling with Data: Learned the importance of framing data within a narrative. Effective decision-making relies not just on numbers, but on how the data is presented and communicated.

Collaborative Data Science: Emphasized teamwork by dividing roles across key focus areas (products, sellers, and delivery) and synthesizing findings to form a cohesive analysis.

Objective Analysis: Practiced maintaining neutrality in data interpretation, ensuring personal biases did not influence the analysis or conclusions.

Business-Oriented Presentations: Realized the distinction between presenting to a business audience and other types of audiences. While passion is valuable, logic, clarity, and a structured approach are essential for impactful business presentations.
## Challenges Overcame
One of the main challenges faced during this project was working with new tools for the first time. Adapting to the technical aspects of SQL, Tableau, and Google Slides required a steep learning curve. However, through consistent practice, self-guided research, and collaboration with my team members, I was able to effectively overcome these challenges and integrate these tools into the project workflow.
## Additional Reflections
This project has been a significant learning experience, offering valuable insights into both the technical and collaborative aspects of data science. Working with multiple tools like SQL, Tableau, and Google Slides not only enhanced my technical skills but also sharpened my ability to approach data analysis in a structured and efficient manner.

Beyond the technical challenges, the project underscored the importance of effective communication in data-driven decision-making. Translating complex data findings into clear, actionable insights required me to think critically about how best to present information to a business audience, ensuring that the story behind the data was conveyed clearly and persuasively.

Collaboration was another key takeaway. Dividing tasks based on expertise and synthesizing individual findings into a cohesive analysis highlighted the importance of teamwork in achieving a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the problem. Working alongside my team members helped me appreciate the value of diverse perspectives in problem-solving and decision-making.

Ultimately, this project reinforced my passion for data analysis and its potential to drive meaningful business decisions, while also teaching me how to balance technical rigor with effective communication.
